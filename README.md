# RSA Encryption in C++

This project demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption in C++.

## Overview

The RSA algorithm is a widely used encryption and decryption technique based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. This implementation provides a simple demonstration of how RSA encryption and decryption can be achieved in C++.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Allows users to generate public and private RSA keys by entering prime numbers.
- **Encryption**: Converts a user-provided string message into an encrypted form using the generated keys.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted message using the corresponding private key.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have:
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
- Standard Library

## Usage

1. **Key Generation:**
   - Run the program and follow the prompts to input two prime numbers.
   - The program will generate public and private keys based on these numbers.

2. **Encryption:**
   - Input a string message to be encrypted using the generated public key.

3. **Decryption:**
   - Input the encrypted message and use the generated private key to decrypt it.

## Example

Here's a basic example of using this code:

```cpp
// Include necessary headers and functions
// Generate keys
// Encrypt a message
// Decrypt the encrypted message
